Now a day many peoples prefer to <strong>buy second hand car instead of buying new one</strong>, as its better investment option where we get almost <strong>30-40% discount</strong>. but main question here is how seller will know <strong>actual selling price of old car</strong> base on car features or which factors play major roles?? So to solve this complex problem, I have build <strong>ML model</strong> which predict <strong>estimated price of car</strong> base on given input features as <strong>brand,KM drive,Power,Year and so on..</strong>

* Completed stepwise <strong>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</strong> and visualization to get data insight & to know <strong>important features also their correlation</strong> with car price
* Done <strong>Feature Engineering</strong> includes <strong>Features extraction & Features construction</strong> based on my domian knowledge and visualization 
* <strong>Train ML models</strong> with multiples regression algorithms then Analysed & compare performance of differents models based of accuracy and complexity
* After comparing, got well accuracy by <strong>RandomForestRegressor(cross validation--around 90%)</strong>
* Finally <strong>Build Web App</strong> using streamlit and <strong>deploy</strong> the model 
* Technical tools or library used -- <code>Python,Numpy,Pandas,sklearn,matplotllib,seaborn,streamlit</code>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/karanchinch10/Oldcar_Sell_Regression">2. Bank Marketing Campaign</a></h1>
<strong>Marketing campaigns</strong> are sets of strategic activities that promote a <strong>business’s goal</strong> or objective. A marketing campaign could be used to promote a product, a service, or the brand as a whole. To achieve the most effective results, campaigns are carefully planned and the activities are varied. Marketing campaigns are characterized by focusing on the <strong>customer needs</strong> and their overall satisfaction.
The following project focus on the analysis of a dataset of <strong>Bank Marketing</strong> which contains data or information about customers and aims to get useful insights from the data and <strong>predict if a new customer will accept a deposit offer or not</strong>.
By understanding important factors or features and <strong>patterns of target customers</strong> those subscribed for deposit so that company can improve this factors and <strong>improve business</strong> and also which will help to get best strategies to improve for the next marketing campaign

- I have made ML model which will predict either new customer will accept offer deposit or not?
- Completed stepwise <strong>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</strong> then visualizatiion to get some idea about important features or correlation 
- Done <strong>Feature Engineering</strong> which includes features extraction & features construction based on domain knowledge and <strong>visualization</strong> followed by label encoding
- Train ML models with multiples algorithms then Analysed & compare <strong>performance of differents models</strong> based of accuracy and complexity
- after comparing with all, got well accuracy by <strong>RandomForest and XG boost</strong> 
- Finally after cross validation <strong>XG boost<strong> won (accuarcy of 85% and <strong>recall score 88%</strong>)
- Build <strong>Pipeline</strong> for <strong>deployment</strong> session
- Technical tools or library used -- <code>Python,Numpy,Pandas,sklearn,matplotllib,XG boost</code>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/karanchinch10/IRIS_Classification">3. IRIS flowers Detection</a></h1>
To determine <strong>class or cateogry of flower</strong> which its belong to base on their 4 features or parameters such as <strong>sepal length,sepal width, petal length and petal width.</strong> Dataset contains total <strong>3 category of flowers</strong> of 50 instances each<strong>(setosa,virginica,versicolor)</strong>, where <strong>each class</strong> refers to a type of <strong>iris plant</strong>. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. contents of <strong>Multiclass classification problem</strong> as below

- <strong>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</strong> and visualization to get <strong>data insight</strong> or important features
- Train model with multiples <strong>classification</strong> algorithms
- Analysed & compare performance of differents models based on <strong>F1 score</strong>
- <strong>SVM and KNN</strong> had given best accuracy 
- Vary K value still accuracy was almost same 97.2 then after <strong>cross validation</strong> SVM accuracy was more than KNN
- Finally Build </strong>web application</strong> using streamlit and <strong>deploy the model.</strong>

<h1><a href="https://github.com/karanchinch10/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-/blob/main/EDA%20data/gplay-playstore-data-visualization-EDA.ipynb">4. Visualization of Google Playstore Apps</a></h1>
<strong>Google Play Store</strong> team is about to launch a new feature wherein, certain apps that are promising, are boosted in visibility. The boost will manifest in multiple ways including <strong>higher priority in recommendations sections</strong> (“Similar apps”, “You might also like”, “New and updated games”). These will also get a boost in search results visibility. This feature will help bring more attention to <strong>newer apps that have the potential.</strong>

- Perform <strong>EDA, Data cleaning and Data correction</strong> 
- Done details <strong>visualization</strong> on gplay store apps to get basic information or data insight and that will be helpful for <strong>decision making</strong> like
   - <strong>Total No of apps</strong> of all category (like games,sports,medical,education,beauty..etc) to understand whcih category has <strong>highest apps</strong> 
   - Which <strong>category</strong> has <strong>highest demand</strong>, rating, installation & reviews
   - Total <strong>percentages of free and paid apps</strong> available in glapy store
   - Which category of apps are <strong>most installed</strong> or like to user
   - <strong>Average price of paid apps</strong> of each category and their demands
   - Is there is any <strong>relation of apps rating and reviews with insatllation?</strong>
- Technical tools or library used -- <code>Python,Numpy,Pandas,sklearn,matplotllib,seaborn,html,css</code>
